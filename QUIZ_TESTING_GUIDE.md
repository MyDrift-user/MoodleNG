     "q{attemptid}:{slot}_sub1_answer": "your answer here",
     "q{attemptid}:{slot}_sub2_answer": "another answer"
   }
   ```
4. **Execute the call**
5. **Expected Result:** Save confirmation

### Step 7: Submit Quiz (Final)

   - Grades and feedback

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "You cannot attempt this quiz at this time"

**Possible Causes:**
- Quiz has time restrictions (not yet open/already closed)
- Maximum attempts reached
- Quiz requires password or specific network
- Browser security restrictions

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check Step 2 (Quiz Access Information)
2. Look at `preventaccessreasons` array
3. Check `accessrules` for restrictions
4. Verify quiz timing in Step 1 results

### Issue: "Failed to start quiz attempt"

**Possible Causes:**
- Already have an in-progress attempt
- Quiz settings prevent new attempts
- Missing required preflight data

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check Step 3 for existing attempts
2. If in-progress attempt exists, use that attempt ID
3. Check if quiz requires password in `preflightdata`

### Issue: Questions not loading

**Possible Causes:**
- Invalid attempt ID
- Attempt not properly started
- Page parameter issues

**Debug Steps:**
1. Verify attempt ID from Step 4
2. Check attempt state is "inprogress"
3. Try different page numbers (0, 1, 2, etc.)

### Issue: Answers not saving

**Possible Causes:**
- Incorrect answer data format
- Invalid question field names
- Attempt already finished

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check question HTML in Step 5 for correct field names
2. Verify attempt is still "inprogress"
3. Use exact field names from question HTML

## Answer Data Format Examples

### Text Input Questions
```json
{
  "q1838014:1_:sequencecheck": "1",
  "q1838014:1_sub1_answer": "had not done",
  "q1838014:1_sub2_answer": "had been looking"
}
```

### Multiple Choice Questions
```json
{
  "q1838014:2_:sequencecheck": "1",
  "q1838014:2_answer": "2"
}
```

### Checkbox Questions
```json
{
  "q1838014:3_:sequencecheck": "1",
  "q1838014:3_choice0": "1",
  "q1838014:3_choice2": "1"
}
```

## Tips for Successful Testing

1. **Always save the attempt ID** from Step 4 - you'll need it for all subsequent calls
2. **Check the question HTML** in Step 5 to understand the exact field names needed
3. **Test with simple answers first** before trying complex question types
4. **Use the browser's developer tools** to inspect network requests if needed
5. **Start with quizzes that have no restrictions** for initial testing

## Debugging Network Issues

If API calls are failing:

1. **Check the browser's Network tab** in Developer Tools
2. **Look for HTTP error codes** (401, 403, 500, etc.)
3. **Verify the Moodle site URL** is correct
4. **Check if your session is still valid** (try other API calls)
5. **Look at the raw response** for detailed error messages

## Next Steps

Once you've successfully tested the API calls manually:

1. **Compare with the quiz-taking component** implementation
2. **Check if the component is using the same parameters**
3. **Verify the component's error handling** matches API responses
4. **Test the component's answer formatting** against working API calls

This systematic approach will help identify exactly where the quiz-taking functionality is failing and provide the data needed to fix it.
