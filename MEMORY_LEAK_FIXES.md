# Memory Leak Fixes and Performance Optimizations

This document summarizes the fixes applied to address memory leaks, excessive timeout usage, excessive code commenting, and performance issues in the MoodleNG application.

## 1. Memory Leak Fixes

### Dashboard Component (`src/app/components/dashboard/dashboard.component.ts`)
- **Added proper subscription management**: Implemented `Subscription` object to track all observables
- **Fixed setInterval cleanup**: Ensured `enrollmentRefreshInterval` is properly cleared in `ngOnDestroy`
- **Added timeout tracking**: Created `messageTimeouts` array to track and cleanup all setTimeout calls
- **Implemented OnDestroy**: Added proper cleanup in `ngOnDestroy` method

### Settings Component (`src/app/components/settings/settings.component.ts`)
- **Added subscription management**: Implemented `Subscription` object for theme settings subscription
- **Implemented OnDestroy**: Added proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Reduced setTimeout usage**: Optimized timeout delays from 1000ms to 500ms

### Theme Service (`src/app/services/theme.service.ts`)
- **Fixed debounce timer cleanup**: Properly clear `debounceTimer` in destroy method
- **Added MutationObserver cleanup**: Ensure observer is disconnected when service is destroyed
- **Optimized DOM manipulation**: Limited DOM queries to prevent performance issues
- **Added requestAnimationFrame**: Used for better performance in theme application

### App Component (`src/app/app.component.ts`)
- **Added subscription management**: Implemented proper subscription tracking
- **Fixed timeout cleanup**: Added cleanup for initialization timeout
- **Implemented OnDestroy**: Added proper resource cleanup

### Login Component (`src/app/components/login/login.component.ts`)
- **Added subscription management**: Implemented proper subscription tracking
- **Fixed timeout cleanup**: Added cleanup for login timeout
- **Reduced timeout delay**: Optimized from 100ms to 50ms

### User Settings Service (`src/app/services/user-settings.service.ts`)
- **Optimized timeout usage**: Implemented single timeout pattern to prevent multiple calls
- **Added proper cleanup**: Implemented destroy method for timeout cleanup
- **Reduced excessive initialization**: Prevented multiple initialization calls

## 2. Performance Optimizations

### Theme Service
- **Limited DOM queries**: Restricted card updates to maximum 20 elements
- **Limited container updates**: Restricted content container updates to maximum 10 elements
- **Added throttling**: Implemented 1-second throttle for theme applications
- **Used requestAnimationFrame**: Better performance for DOM updates

### Dashboard Component
- **Optimized message clearing**: Replaced multiple setTimeout calls with tracked timeout system
- **Improved subscription management**: All subscriptions are now properly tracked and cleaned up

## 3. Excessive Logging Cleanup

### Moodle Service (`src/app/services/moodle.service.ts`)
- **Removed debug logs**: Eliminated excessive console.log statements in module processing
- **Kept error logging**: Maintained important error logging for debugging

### Settings Component
- **Environment-based logging**: Added environment checks to only log in development mode
- **Reduced constructor logging**: Removed unnecessary console.log statements

### Theme Service
- **Reduced server status logging**: Simplified logging for database availability checks
- **Removed excessive success/error logs**: Kept only essential error logging

### App Component
- **Removed initialization logs**: Eliminated unnecessary console.log statements
- **Kept essential error logging**: Maintained important error handling

## 4. Code Structure Improvements

### Environment Configuration
- **Created environment file**: Added `src/environments/environment.ts` for production checks
- **Implemented development-only logging**: Used environment.production checks

### Subscription Management Pattern
- **Consistent pattern**: Implemented consistent subscription management across all components
- **Proper cleanup**: All components now implement OnDestroy with proper cleanup

### Timeout Management
- **Tracked timeouts**: All setTimeout calls are now tracked and cleaned up
- **Reduced delays**: Optimized timeout delays for better user experience
- **Single timeout pattern**: Prevented multiple timeout calls in services

## 5. Benefits

### Memory Usage
- **Reduced memory leaks**: Proper subscription and timeout cleanup
- **Better garbage collection**: Resources are properly released when components are destroyed

### Performance
- **Faster DOM updates**: Limited and optimized DOM manipulation
- **Reduced CPU usage**: Eliminated excessive logging and optimized timeout usage
- **Better responsiveness**: Reduced timeout delays and improved cleanup

### Maintainability
- **Cleaner code**: Removed excessive comments and debug logs
- **Consistent patterns**: Implemented consistent cleanup patterns across components
- **Better error handling**: Maintained essential error logging while removing noise

## 6. Testing Recommendations

1. **Memory Testing**: Monitor memory usage during navigation between components
2. **Performance Testing**: Test theme switching performance with multiple elements
3. **Subscription Testing**: Verify all subscriptions are properly cleaned up
4. **Timeout Testing**: Ensure all timeouts are cleared when components are destroyed

## 7. Future Improvements

1. **Consider using OnPush change detection**: For better performance in large lists
2. **Implement virtual scrolling**: For components with many items
3. **Add service worker**: For better caching and performance
4. **Consider lazy loading**: For feature modules to reduce initial bundle size
